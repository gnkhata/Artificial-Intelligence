# Artificial-Intelligence

Projects for Artificial Intelligence class at University of Arkansas Spring 2023.

**project1.ipynb** performs the following different tasks independently.
* Implements class and inheritance in Python.
* Implements matrix multiplication
* Implements powers of a matrix separately using a recursive function and an iterative function.
* Implements fibonacci number.
* Implemenst Breadth First Search and Depth First Search: You are given an $m \times n$ matrix (𝑚,𝑛 are the number of rows and columns, respectively), and the matrix is a zero-based index (the index of row and column start from 0). Each cell of the matrix will have a number. It will be either 0 or 1, 0 means you cannot access this cell, and 1 means you can access this cell. You are in the cell (0,0), the mission is to find the path that reaches the cell (𝑚−1,𝑛−1). It should be noted that at each step, we are just allowed to move to adjacent cells. Particularly, if you are in the cell (𝑥,𝑦), you can move to either cell (𝑥−1,𝑦) or (𝑥,𝑦−1) or (𝑥+1,𝑦) or (𝑥,𝑦+1). Also, you have to make sure that you are not going out of the matrix and you cannot access any cells that contain 0 (of course, values of cell (0,0) and cell (𝑚−1,𝑛−1) are 1). In addition, you are just allowed to go to each cell at most one time. 

**project2.ipynb** uses various convolutional networks, e.g. ResNet to perform image classification.
